Here, I am taking a relative layout and inside this layout, we have a linear layout having an orientation vertical.
I am taking two TextInputEditText and one TextView inside this linear layout. 
I have used MaterialCardView to design the TextInputEditText and TextView.
Now I am taking another linear layout having an orientation horizontal.
We have to take four material buttons for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations inside this inner linear layout.

First, we have used supportActionBar to change the background color of ActionBar.
Now we applied setOnClickListener to all the buttons which are defined in the activity_main.xml. 
When the user clicks on any button, the inputIsNotEmpty() function will be called and this method will check whether the input field is empty or not. 
If any input field is empty then it will return a false value otherwise it will return a true value. 
If the inputIsNotEmpty() function returns a true value then statements that are written inside if() condition of a particular method will be executed.
For example, if we click on the plus button then add() method will be called, and inside add() method first it will check inputIsNotEmpty() method to return a true or false value. 
If a value is true then the addition of input numbers will be displayed on textview.
